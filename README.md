# Straight-Ribbons
This is a screen saver like the default windows ribbons one except more jagged.

How to install:

Download the latest release, extract the zip and put its contents somewhere safe. Then right-click on Straight Ribbons.scr and click install. Then set the amount of time before it opens and click ok.

Warning: This screen saver may be laggy as it is just an electron application with a .scr extension
